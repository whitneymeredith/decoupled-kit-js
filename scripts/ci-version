pnpm changeset version

# pkgVersions.json in the create-pantheon-decoupled-kit
# source code which can be used to determine the versions
# to use for our dependencies in the starter templates. Thus, canary releases
# will ship with canary tagged versions of packages and regular
# releases will ship with the latest released versions
