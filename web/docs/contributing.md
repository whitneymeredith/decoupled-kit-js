## Prerequisites

To configure the monorepo for development, the following should be installed
locally:

- Nodejs version 16 LTS. We recomemnd using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm) version 8.x.x
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) version 8.1.0

  We recommend using npm. Run the following command to install:

  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm@8.1.0
  ```

## Getting Started

1. Fork [this](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/decoupled-kit-js/fork) repo.
1. Clone your fork to your local machine.
1. Install dependencies for all packages and starters using the following
   command:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```
1. Install the
   [husky pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/decoupled-kit-js/blob/canary/.husky/pre-commit).
   Run the following command:
   ```
   pnpm husky install
   ```

### Useful Scripts

There are several scripts you can use on your monorepo.

- Test all projects in the monorepo that have a test script:
  ```bash
  pnpm test
  ```
- Build all packages in the monorepo:
  ```bash
  pnpm build:pkgs
  ```
- Build all starters in the monorepo:
  ```bash
  pnpm build:starters
  ```
- Build all projects in the monorepo:

  ```bash
  pnpm build:all
  ```

- Run commands in a targeted project, folder, or workspace, using the `pnpm`
  [filter flag](https://pnpm.io/filtering).

  For example, to start the Gatsby starter from the root of the monorepo (filter
  by namespace):

  ```bash
  pnpm --filter './starters/gatsby-wordpress-starter' develop
  ```

- Lint in the starters and filter by directory:

  ```bash
  pnpm --filter './starters/**' lint
  ```

- Run documentation:

  ```bash
  pnpm --filter './web' start
  ```

## Versions and Releases

### Generating a Changeset

To generate a new changeset, run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository.
The generated Markdown files in the `.changeset` directory should be committed
to the repository.

### Creating and Publishing New Versions

Versions and releases are created as part of our CI process and typically should
not be created manually.
