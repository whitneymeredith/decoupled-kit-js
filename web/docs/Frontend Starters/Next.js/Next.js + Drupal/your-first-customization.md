## Before You Begin

This guide assumes the reader has working knowledge of
[React](https://reactjs.org/), and little to no knowledge of
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Data Fetching in Next.js

Next.js offers various ways to fetch data and render content. Please see the
Next.js
[Data Fetching Overview](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview)
for an in depth look at each. For the purposes of this guide, we will cover
creating a page with
[Server Side Rendering (SSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering)
and
[Static Site Generation (SSG)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended).

:::info If you're not sure when to use SSR vs SSG, check out these articles:
[When Should I Use `getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props#when-should-i-use-getserversideprops)
and

### Fetching Drupal Content with DrupalState

The `next-drupal-starter` has a dependency on `@pantheon-systems/drupal-kit`,
which implements
[Drupal State](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/drupal_state/en/introduction/) -
a tool that helps fetch and store data from Drupal into the local app state.

### SSR Example

To render a page with Server Side Rendering (SSR) in Next.js, export an async
function called
[`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)
from that page. Inside of this function, we can use Drupal State to fetch data
from Drupal and pass it to the component as props.

```jsx title=pages/articles/index.js
import { DrupalState } from '@pantheon-systems/drupal-kit';

export default function Articles({ articles }) {
	return <pre>{JSON.stringify(articles, null, 4)}</pre>;
}

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
	const { locale } = context; // use the current locale in order to fetch correct translation

	const store = new DrupalState({
		apiBase: process.env.BACKEND_URL,
		defaultLocale: locale,
	});

	const articles = await store.getObject({
		objectName: 'node--article',
		// Drupal State allows us to use a graphql query to get the data we need and nothing extra
		query: `
      {
        title
        body
        created
        path {
          alias
        }
      }
    `,
	});

	return {
		props: {
			articles,
		},
	};
}
```

### SSG Example

If we want to use SSG, export
[`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props)
from a page to generate that page at _build_ time instead of _request_ time.

Let's build a page using `getStaticProps` that lists recipes from our Drupal
instance.

```jsx title=pages/recipes/index.js
import { DrupalState } from '@pantheon-systems/drupal-kit';

export default function Recipes({ recipes }) {
	return <pre>{JSON.stringify(recipes, null, 4)}</pre>;
}

export async function getStaticProps(context) {
	const { locale } = context; // use the current locale in order to fetch correct translation

	const store = new DrupalState({
		apiBase: process.env.BACKEND_URL,
		defaultLocale: locale,
	});

	const recipes = await store.getObject({
		objectName: 'node--recipe',
		query: `
      {
        title
        field_ingredients
        field_number_of_servings
        field_preparation_time
        field_recipe_instruction
        field_summary
        created
        path {
          alias
        }
      }
    `,
	});

	return {
		props: {
			recipes,
		},
	};
}
```

Notice the only real difference for this page–besides the fact we are fetching
recipes instead of articles–is the use of `getStaticProps` instead of
`getServerSideProps`.

### Client Side Rendering (CSR) Example

In some cases, you may wish to fetch and render the data on the client. In these
cases, you can leverage the same `DrupalState` store that is available to you in
the server contexts, HOWEVER, it should be noted this is not the same instance
of the store that exists on the server, thus the store is not shared between the
client and the server. Client side rendering is not usually necessary with a
framework like Next.js.

The CSR pattern here is the same as it is with vanilla React.

:::note You will need to configure your Drupal instance to allow your frontend
site through CORS to achieve CSR. Also, be aware that the store is not shared
between the client and server contexts.

:::

```jsx title=pages/articles-csr/index.js
import { DrupalState } from '@pantheon-systems/drupal-kit';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function Articles() {
	const { locale } = useRouter();
	const [articles, setArticles] = useState([]);
	/**
	 * We recommend creating as few instances of
	 * DrupalState as possible and reusing them
	 * throughout the application.
	 * We are creating a new one here
	 * for example purposes.
	 */
	const store = new DrupalState({
		/**
		 * In order to create the store on the client
		 * side, you will need to expose your
		 * BACKEND_URL in your next.config.env
		 * so that it can be read on the client side.
		 * This should not cause any issues security
		 * wise if your Drupal instance is
		 * configured appropriately.
		 */
		apiBase: process.env.backendUrl,
		defaultLocale: locale,
	});
	useEffect(async () => {
		if (!articles.length) {
			const data = await store.getObject({
				objectName: 'node--article',
			});
			setArticles(data);
		}
	}, []);

	if (articles) {
		return <pre>{JSON.stringify(articles, null, 4)}</pre>;
	}
}
```

## Next Steps

From here, it's time to see the code in action. Start the app if it's not
already running and head to `http://localhost:3000/articles`. You should see the
SSR'd `Articles` page. Navigate to `/recipes` to see the SSG'd `Recipes` page,
and `/csr-articles` to se the CSR'd page.

From this point, you may want to adjust the markup and style of the `Articles`
and `Recipes` components, or move on to another custom page. For more
information on composing react components, see
[Composing Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#composing-components)

## Conclusion

In this guide we created a new page using SSR, SSG, and CSR utilizing Drupal
State to fetch data from our Drupal instance.
