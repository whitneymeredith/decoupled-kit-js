## Before You Begin

This guide assumes the reader has working knowledge of
[React](https://reactjs.org/), little to no knowledge of
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

## Gatsby's GraphQL Layer

The
[`gatsby-source-wordpress` plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-wordpress/)
makes use of the [WPGraphQL WordPress plugin](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) in
order to efficiently cache WordPress data in Gatsby. This plugin is configured
to successfully source data out of the box. To do so, provide your GraphQL
Endpoint in `.env.local` as WPGRAPHQL_URL. For example:

```
WPGRAPHQL_URL=https://dev-my-wordpress-site.pantheon.site/wp/graphql
```

Starting the app in develop mode will fetch all the data from your WordPress
instance and make it available to Gatsby's GraphQL IDE. By default this is
available at http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql.

Use this GraphQL IDE to construct queries to be used for
[page queries](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/recipes/querying-data/#querying-data-with-a-page-query),
[static queries](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/querying-data/static-query/)
or
[`createPages`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/#createPages)

See https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/ for an in depth
look at Gatsby's GraphQL Data Layer.

## Sourcing Data From WordPress

Let's build a few queries together to use for some new pages. The index page
will display the last 5 posts. Each post page will display the post as well as
any comments that belong to that post.

There will be two queries, plus an additional query to use with Gatsby's
`createPages` utility. One query is for the index page, and the other is for the
individual blog posts.

### Index Page Query

For the index page we want to limit the data to the last 5 blog posts in
descending order. If you're familiar with GraphiQL IDEs, feel free to type in
the fields in the middle pane instead of selecting them from the **Explorer**
pane.

1. Start your Gatsby app with the `WPGRAPHQL_URL` environment variable set
1. Navigate to the GraphiQL IDE at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`
1. From the **Explorer** pane on the left side of the page, select `allWpPost`.
1. Add the **limit** variable and set it to 5.
1. Under **limit**, select **sort** > **fields** and then from the dropdown
   select **date**. You may type 'date' while the dropdown is open to help
   select it.
1. Set **order** to **DESC**
1. Select **allWpPost** > **nodes**. Select **title**, **uri**, and **date**.
1. Select **allWpPost** > **author** > **nodes**, and select **name**

Our query should look like this:

```graphql
query IndexPage {
	allWpPost(limit: 5, sort: { fields: date, order: DESC }) {
		nodes {
			id
			title
			date
			uri
			author {
				node {
					name
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Now you may test the query in the editor with the play button at the top.
Results will be displayed in the pane to the right. Copy the ID of a post to
help test the next section.

### Individual Post Query

For the individual pages, we will want some more detail. We will have the post
id
[available to us via `pageContext`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/creating-and-modifying-pages/#creating-pages-in-gatsby-nodejs)
which we can use to get more info on the individual post.

1. Start your Gatsby app with the `WPGRAPHQL_URL` environment variable set
1. Navigate to the GraphiQL IDE at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`
1. Open the **Query Variables** pane on the bottom of the page.
1. Set a variable `id` equal to the ID you noted down from the last section. For
   example:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
  ```json
  {
    "id": "cG9zdDo0Mw=="
  }
  ```

1. From the **Explorer** pane on the left side of the page, select `wpPost`.
1. Select **wpPost** > **id** > **eq:**. Click the **$** to insert the variable
   into the query. You may need to rename the variable or edit the query
   manually. At this point you should have the following:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
  ```graphql
  query PostWithCommentsById($id: String!) {
    wpPost(id: {eq: $id}) {

    }
  }
  ```

1. Select **wpPost** > **content**, and **date** > **formatString** input
   `"MM/YY"
1. Select **wpPost** > **author** > **node**, and select **name**
1. Select **wpPost** > **comments** > **nodes**. Select **content**, **title**,
   **date** > **formatString** input `"MM/YY hh:mmA"`. Also select **author** >
   **node** > **name**

The query should look like the following:

```graphql
query PostWithCommentsById($id: String!) {
	wpPost(id: { eq: $id }) {
		author {
			node {
				name
			}
		}
		comments {
			nodes {
				author {
					node {
						name
					}
				}
				content
				date(formatString: "MM/YY hh:mmA")
			}
		}
		title
		content
		date(formatString: "MM/YY")
	}
}
```

## Consuming the Data in Gatsby

Now we should have two queries, `IndexPage`, and `PostWithCommentsById`. We'll
need one more short query for the `createPages` API. It will be included in the
next section.

:::info

Gatsby's GraphiQL IDE's **Code Exporter** tab generates code snippets based on
the current query in the editor pane. Choose from Page Query, StaticQuery hook,
StaticQuery, and createPages.

:::

### Creating Templates

Part of creating pages with Gatsby involves
[specifying a template](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/programmatically-create-pages-from-data/#specifying-a-template).
In this section, we'll use the queries we created to create a template for the
index page and the individual posts.

1. In your Gatsby project, create a new file in the `src/templates` directory
   called `last-five-post.js`
1. To keep things simple, we'll use the **Code Exporter** tab from the GraphiQL
   IDE. Select **Page query** from the dropdown menu and copy the code into
   `last-five-post.js`.

### Routing with `createPages`

We'll need to construct one more short query in order to tell Gatsby to generate
pages at certain paths. Notice that this query is a stripped down version of the
previous query, because all we need is the slug.

Here is an example of the `createPages` code which can be added to
`gatsby-node.js` and the pages will be fetched and created at build time. We
want the `uri` as the slug for our new page, and the `id` to pass into our Page
Query.

```javascript title=gatsby-node.js
const path = require(`path`);

exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions }) => {
	const { createPage } = actions;

	const result = await graphql(`
		{
			allWpPost(limit: 5, sort: { fields: date, order: DESC }) {
				nodes {
					id
					uri
				}
			}
		}
	`);
	const indexTemplatePath = path.resolve(`./src/templates/last-five-post.js`);

	result.data.allWpPost.nodes.forEach((node) => {
		createPage({
			path: node.uri,
			component: indexTemplatePath,
			// The context is passed as props to the component as well
			// as into the component's GraphQL query.
			context: {
				id: node.id,
			},
		});
	});
};
```

We've edited the code from the **Code Exporter** tab slightly.

- Pointed the `templatePath` to our template from the previous step
- Passed `node.uri` to the `path` property of `createPage`
- Passed `node.id` to the context of `createPage`

This code should generate 5 pages, one for each of the last 5 blog posts. Now
inside of our template, we can use the query we created

For more information on Gatsby's `createPage`, see
[the API reference](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createPage)
and
[Creating Pages in `gatsby-node.js`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/creating-and-modifying-pages/#creating-pages-in-gatsby-nodejs)

Next, we will create our index page in the next section with a different routing
technique.

### Index Page

For pages that don't need to be dynamically created, we can define routes in
`src/pages`. See
[Define routes in `src/pages`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/creating-routes/#define-routes-in-srcpages)
for more information.

All we need for this page is a component and our index page query. We will use
the Page Query from the **Code Exporter** tab.

1. Create a new file in `src/pages` called `last-five.js`
1. Paste in the component from the **Code Exporter** tab

The file should like like this:

```jsx title=src/pages/last-five.js
import React from 'react';
import { graphql } from 'gatsby';

const ComponentName = ({ data }) => <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 4)}</pre>;

export const query = graphql`
	{
		allWpPost(limit: 5, sort: { fields: date, order: DESC }) {
			nodes {
				id
				title
				date
				uri
				author {
					node {
						name
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
`;

export default ComponentName;
```

That's all for this page. Check out the next section to see how everything works
together.

## Next Steps

From here, it's time to see the code in action. Start the app if it's not
already running and head to `http://localhost:8000/last-five`. You should see
your `last-five.js` page rendered with the data from the Page query.

Now navigate to `http://localhost:8000/{uri of one of your posts}`. (You should
be able to see the post uris on the `/last-five` route, or check your GraphiQL
IDE.) The `last-five-post.js` template should be rendered there.

From here you should be able to query Gatsby's GraphQL layer to get the data you
need right where you need it.

## Conclusion
